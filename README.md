DIRECTED  GRAPH   CONTRACTION 

Given Program is Implementation of Directed Graph Contraction.
     In graph theory , an edge contraction in directed graph is an operation which removes an edges from a graph while simultaneously      merging the two vertices that is previously joined.
Example: 
Step 1: 	u and v are two	vertices			
Step 2:   w =  u , v
In Program :
Input :  Adjacency  Matrix as,
                    0 : 1,2
										1 : 3
										2 : 8,9
										3 : 4,6
                    4 : 2,6 
                    5 : 1,6
										6 : 7,8
										7 : 5,8
										8 : 9
										9 : 4
Output: Contracted Graph in Random Vertices.
